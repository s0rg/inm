# Impaled Northern Moonforest song title generator

[What its all about](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seth_Putnam#Impaled_Northern_Moonforest)

The original generator was originally available at http://inm.necrobation.org, but its dead, so only way to obtain it
is [web-archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20060816025359fw_/http://inm.necrobation.org/generator.zip).

This generator is result of reverse-enginering binary (PE32 written in VB 6.0) to make results as close to original as
possible, so code is pure hell ðŸ˜ˆ

# installation

- [binaries / deb / rpm](https://github.com/s0rg/inm/releases) for Linux, FreeBSD, macOS and Windows.

# usage

Just run the `inmfortune` and enjoy.
